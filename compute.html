          <p>Industry analysts say that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Lambda</a> is a game changer. We agree.</p>

          <p>Distributed, resilient, collaborating networks of compute nodes are the future of applications in a connected world.</p>

          <p id="sign-up"><span class="compute-name">Compute</span> is a service to run distributed, resilient, scalable apps on the Rubinius language platform. Like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Lambda</a>, you pay for computing, not for having a computer sitting there waiting to run your app.</p>

          <p>The rise of mobile forced deep changes in the way GUIs are built. To a lesser extent, it also affected how apps are built.</p>

          <p>The rising tide of connected devices will force deep changes in the way apps are built. Many apps will not have any UI.</p>

          <p>This is happening now, under the name <span class="compute-em">microservices</span>. These are distributed, resilient, interdependent, scalable, and relatively simple computation resources.</p>

          <p>Computers are the most powerful, versatile tools that humans have created.</p>

          <p>In a few short decades, computers have gone from nonexistent to affecting nearly everyone's life in some way. Many people use computers, but only via the confines of the apps built by a relatively tiny percentage.</p>

          <p>Access to, and direct use of, computers is the most radical transformation of human society since the rise of democracy.</p>

          <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> (Elastic Compute Cloud) was the first large-scale shift toward abstracting computation resources.</p>

          <p>Following this, first generation PaaS (Platform as a Service) promised simpler production environments by generalizing the platform for running apps.</p>

          <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Lambda</a> is nearly pure CaaS (Compute as a Service). The platform and infrastructure are abstracted away, leaving only the app as computation.</p>

          <p><span class="compute-name">Compute</span> combines three ideas: broad access to computation resources, languages to solve problems, and <a href="http://analyst.rubinius.com">a platform for understanding your apps</a>.</p>
