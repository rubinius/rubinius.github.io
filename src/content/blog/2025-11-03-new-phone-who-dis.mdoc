## How Can I Help?

### Projects

A system as complex as Rubinius involves a lot of moving pieces. Making sense of these at a highe level can be difficult.

We're using GitHub Projects at the organization level to help group work into subject areas according to these higher level concepts for a language platform. There are various views available, including boards and roadmaps, for understanding how work in one of these areas is progressing.

These are the current projects:

1. **[LLVM-based Compiler](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/2)**: Using WebAssembly LLVM backend as inspiration, create an fully integrated LLVM-based compiler toolchain that can emit code for the Rubinius ISA or a machine target, unifying the previous bytecode compiler and JIT machine code compiler.
1. **[Build System & Packaging](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/7)**: Work related to removing Ruby and implementing build2 as the Rubinius build system and integrating Rubinius with popular package managers like Homebrew, Ubuntu, RHEL, and Arch.
1. **[Concurrency & Performance](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/6)**: Work focused on improving multi-core concurrency and parallelism and optimizing performance.
1. **[CodeDB & IPFS/Noria](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/5)**: Work focused on generalizing code artifacts from on-disk to IPFS or Noria caches.
1. **[Parsers & PEGs](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/4)**: Work focused on completing the PEG (parsing expression grammar) segment of the Rubinius ISA (instruction set architecture) and implementing parser for other languages (eg Python) using these facilities.
1. **[Heaps & Garbage Collection](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/3)**: Work focused on creating three distinct heaps in Rubinius: open, closed, isolated. Also bringing concepts from FBIP and Perceus garbage collection to Rubinius. Heaps support functionality like Actors.
1. **[Update Ruby Support](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/8)**: Work related to updating the Ruby language version supported by the parser and the Ruby core and standard libraries to be able to run apps like Rails and Metasploit.
1. **[Contributions & Social Media](https://github.com/orgs/rubinius/projects/1)**: Coordinate contributions under a new license and organizational structure (foundation) and improve the Rubinius social media presence.

### Roadmap

While having a good overview of various areas of the system is helpful, sometimes it's also important to know when a particular capability will be available, and what are the tasks necessary to achieve that.

GitHub has repository-level milestones that are useful for this. Milestones are not (yet) well-integrated with organization-level projects, but issues that are part of a milestone can also be part of projects.

These are the current milestones organized by GitHub repository:

* **[rubinius/compiler-ng](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng)**
  * [1a: LLVM end-to-end compiler](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/milestone/1)
  * [1b: Language interface to the compiler](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/milestone/2)
  * [3a: Tier-1 JIT](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/milestone/3)
  * [3b: Language interface to the JIT](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/milestone/4)
  * [4: Language updates](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/milestone/5)
  * [10: Tier-N JIT](https://github.com/rubinius/compiler-ng/milestone/6)

* **[rubinius/rubinius](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius)**
  * [2: Rubinius build system & GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/milestone/6)
  * [5: Rubygems+Bundler running](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/milestone/7)
  * [6: Ruby core library passing specs](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/milestone/8)
