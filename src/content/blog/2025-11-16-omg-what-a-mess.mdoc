*"Like fences make good neighbors, boundaries make good systems."*&mdash;Probably
Someone Famous

If someone famous didn't say that, they probably should have, but I'll take
credit so it's not just some anonymous thing floating out there like an orphan.

But regardless of which precise words an LLM might use to construct such a
sentence from the ruminations of billions of people, the idea is pretty simple,
and profound.

I'd go so far as to say that without it, no life would exist.  Because, in
fact, this is precisely how life works. I learned that this probably has to do
with how the ratio of surface area to volume of a cell changes as the dimenions
of the cell grows and the need to transport energy materials and waste across
that cell boundary.

In the artificial (i.e. not living) things humans muster, there is not this
obvious constraint, and so things like
[monorepos](https://infinitejs.com/posts/monorepos-problems-solved/) and
[Bazel](https://bazel.build) can continue to exist (along with an ecosystem of
things supporting it, like [Copybara](https://github.com/google/copybara) and
this guy who told me, "I believe in monorepos' like they're some kind of
middle-tier deity) long after they should be historical footnotes in obscure
compsci trivia.
