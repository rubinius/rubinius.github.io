        <h3>Become a Contributor</h3>

        <p>Join <a href="https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius/graphs/contributors">over 400 people</a> who have contributed their time and expertise to building Rubinius. Whether you code, design, write, tutor, mentor, research, or dabble, there is an opportunity to <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=How can I help contribute to Rubinius">add your mark</a> to Rubinius.</p>

        <p>Open source projects need diverse help but have difficulty attracting participation from people who don't view coding as their primary activity. Business, marketing, writing and communication, design, and teaching skills are valued highly. Even if you're unsure how you can help, but Rubinius sounds like an exciting project, <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=I'd like to help Rubinius">let us know</a>.</p>

        <h3>Employee Contributions</h3>

        <p>Many companies have discovered that providing employees with some time to pursue an interesting idea can pay big dividends or even spawn entirely new products.</p>

        <p>If you sponsor your employee's work on open source projects and would like to contribute to Rubinius, <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring employee contributions to Rubinius">tell us about it</a> so we can give your company and employee the credit they deserve.</p>

        <h3>The Rubinius Book</h3>

        <p>The forms of communicating knowledge are expanding tremendously with the Internet and the rich digital media it enables. Even so, books remain one of the most effective ways to organize information for sharing.</p>

        <p>The Rubinius book is an ambitious project to completely document the Rubinius platform, development approach, community social structure, problem solving, and experimentation with programming languages. Sponsoring Rubinius book content provides one of the highest returns in a virtuous circle of learning and building, and <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring Rubinius book content">your sponsorship</a> would receive prominent recognition in the book.</p>

        <p>Academia and industry have different goals. Academia prioritize novelty. Since big ideas are few, this leads to specialization ond then compartmentalization. Business must be profitable to exist, so industry prioritizes working systems that generate revenue. These systems are rarely novel and tend quickly toward complexity.</p>

        <p>The Rubinius book balances these opposed goals by documenting a complete, complex, working system, while encouraging focused, specialized learning or research.</p>

        <h3>Interns and Student Projects</h3>

        <p>Learning to code is becoming increasingly important, and not merely for a career in software development. As all professions use software more, and as software becomes more controllable through APIs (application programming interfaces), there is more opportunity or need to write code.</p>

        <p>One of the focuses of Rubinius is learning about programming systems. It provides an excellent opportunity for an intern or student to gain practical experience with a complete industrial system like one they would encounter in a job versus only an academic research system. You can sponsor one of your interns to work on Rubinius or <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Sponsoring an intern or student">work with us</a> to find a code school or university student to sponsor.</p>

        <p>Rubinius is an extensive project composed of many components. We prioritize features based on what we know about how useful they can be. If there are features that would be particularly valuable to your business, <a href="mailto:contact@rubinius.com?subject=Funding specific Rubinius projects">let's discuss</a> how you might fund focused work on those features. You agree that the work be contributed to Rubinius and your business would receive prominent recognition for the contribution in <a href="http://book.rubinius.com">the Rubinius book</a>.</p>

        <p>Rubinius is pursing ambitious advances in the utility of programming languages and applications. Various components that significantly advance the Rubinius vision would benefit from funding.</p>

        <p>From monolithic application architectures to microservices, from legacy IT infrastructure to cloud, containers, and serverless compute, the pace of technology change is accelerating. Staying current is essential to staying competitive. Yet this constant march forward should not come at the significant cost of discarding investments that are still providing value. Applications and infrastructure should be <em>evolving</em>, not merely getting replaced.</p>

        <p>Rubinius, Inc seeks cofounders from diverse and under-represented groups with experience in or deep dedication to learning business, marketing, teaching, partnerships, and technology.</p>

        <p>The intersection of connected devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and programming languages promise extensive changes in the way software is built and used. Conversational interfaces and autonomous will dominate.</p>

        <p>Existing programming languages and methods of building software primtive, costly, and ill-suited to the present and future software requirements, which involve distribution, resilience, rapid change, and extensive context.</p>
